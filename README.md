ðŸ“˜ Next Word Prediction using LSTM (Deep Learning)

ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project implements a Next Word Prediction model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks.
It is trained on Shakespeareâ€™s Hamlet text and deployed as a Streamlit web application, where users can input a sequence of words and get the predicted next word in real-time.
The model also uses Early Stopping to prevent overfitting during training.
